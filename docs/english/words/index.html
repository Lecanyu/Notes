<h2 id="talk-about-jobs">Talk about jobs</h2>
<p>I work for XX company.</p>

<p>I work in + field. (I work in finance. I work in digital marketing. I work in HR department of a financial firm.)</p>

<p>I run my own business, so I work for myself.</p>

<p>I work for a international company which does market research for other companies.</p>

<p>I’m a freelancer (meaning I work independently for different people and companies)</p>

<p>I’m between jobs at the moment (meaning I left one job and haven’t found another job yet)</p>

<p>I’m a nurse. I have to look after patients, give them medicine and make sure they’re comfortable. I’m reponsible for about 20-30 patients. Most of my time is spent talking to them and checking everything is OK.</p>

<p>I have to design websites to the client’s specifications. I’m responsible for the whole design process, so I have to take client’s ideas and turn them into a finished product. Most of my time is spent experimenting with different designs and ideas and seeing what design looks good. Because attention to the detail is important in this kind of job.</p>

<p>The positive adjectives for describing your feeling about job:</p>
<ul>
  <li>stimulating (meaning exciting and gives you energy)</li>
  <li>satisfying</li>
  <li>creative</li>
  <li>rewarding (it is usually used to describe jobs in which you help other people. For example, teachers and nurses may describe their job as rewarding)</li>
  <li>challenging</li>
</ul>

<p>The negative adjectives for describing your feeling about job:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exhausting</li>
  <li>thinkless</li>
  <li>mind-numbing</li>
  <li>dead-end</li>
  <li>soul-destroying (extremely unpleasant, boring and which you really hate)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a pharmacist. I started my own small pharmacy. So I’m also a business owner. I have to work as a pharmacist, of course, giving advice to patients and making sure they have the right medicine. However, I’m also reponsible for the pharmacy, so I have to manage my staff, do the accounts, and so on. It’s stimulating work because I have to do many different things every day, so I never get bored.</p>

<p>I’m a writer. I work in online education. I work for a big publishing company, which produces different educational materials which are used all around the world. I have to write lesson plans and materials for teachers to use in the classroom. I spend most of my time to think how I can make different things fit together into a lesson. It’s a very challenging work and it can be exhausting. But it’s also very creative and satifying, because I know people all around the world are using lessons which I wrote.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-money">Talk about money</h2>
<p>You go to hoilday again? How can you afford it? I can barely pay my rent each month.</p>

<p>How do you stick to it?</p>

<p>spend money &lt;-&gt; save money &lt;-&gt; waste money.
They waste a lot of money on things they don’t need.</p>

<p>Big spender &lt;-&gt; frugal. (Both are neutral words, no positive or negative meaning)
Are you a big spender? or more frugal?</p>

<p>save money for sth &lt;-&gt; save money to do sth.
I’m saving up for a holiday next year.</p>

<p>make a budget. 
Cut back on sth.
Splash out.
Treat yourself.</p>

<p>My friends live in London and earn a decent money. But they don’t have much leftover at the end of month. Mostly, they just getting by.</p>

<p>You can say you make a good money or make a decent money, if your salary is above average. (You are well-off)</p>

<p>If you only make just enough to cover your costs, you can say you just getting by. (You have enough money to live but not much more)
For example, I don’t earn a lot but I get by.</p>

<p>If someone even cannot make enough money to cover the basic expenses like rent, food and transport, they are struggling (you can also say make ends meet).
I can barely make ends meet. He’s struggling to make ends meet. I don’t know how make ends meet if we had another child.</p>

<p>take out a loan. Mortgage.
repay a loan.
He cannot keep up the interest.</p>

<p>in debt: you owe money.</p>

<p>It will take us another ten years to pay off our mortgage.</p>

<p>The interest on our car loan is ridiculously high.</p>

<p>I never borrow money, I don’t like being in debt.</p>

<p>Buy sth on credit.</p>

<p>max out a credit card means that you borrow maximum money from the credit card.</p>

<p>If you cannot pay off your debt, you may declare bankruptcy (your debts will be cancelled but you will lose anything you have which is worth money)</p>

<p>You can invest something like shares=stocks/bonds/funds.</p>

<p>The shares will take off and I will double or even triple my money.</p>

<p>If shares go up very fast, you can say take off.
If it goes down very fast, you can say crash.
For example, they lost a lot of money when the stock market crashed in 2008.</p>

<p>You may lose everything and get wiped out.</p>
