These notes are used to record something for reviewing. It created by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with Mathjax supporting. The template comes from a course note [cs228-notes](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/). Have a look its github source [code](https://github.com/ermongroup/cs228-notes).

You can also visit [Tufte (github)](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) (the source files in \_posts directory) and [web visualization](https://clayh53.github.io/tufte-jekyll/articles/15/tufte-style-jekyll-blog) to understand how to use this template.

If have any format questions, try to google it with **Mathjax, jekyll, tufte** keywords.


Note: since github doesn't support 3rd plugins like Mathjax, you should compile the source code (i.e. the .md files) to .html in your local machine. And then, copy all files in \_site directory to docs directory. Remember to modify the repository settings -> GitHub Pages -> Source -> master branch /docs folder

Command for Compiling and viewing

```
jekyll serve
```
